Koen's contribution to the TopDownAndroid game


I personally did not add any code to the project.

However I did help my teammates Create the .APK file and importing the AndroidSDK.

I also figured out how to add Ads into the game to get some revenue from the game.

I also gave advise to the coders on how to succesfully implement the new controls.
